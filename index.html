		<h1>Payton Lee</h1>
		<p>Payton Lee was once a very curious woman who dabbled with the ball licking. After about 3 years of continously attending
		ball licking conventions, she met a man named Elliot. Ever since he said, "I think you're pretty", she was heartstruck
		and could never leave his arms. Payton vowed to never attend another ball licking convetion as long as Elliot was still in
		her life. It has since been 6 months since Payton's last ball licking convention.</p>
